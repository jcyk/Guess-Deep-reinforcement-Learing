Deep Q Learning for the game of guessing word


It implements the DQL algorithm as well as serveral recent advances in that filed, and applied to a game which is a popular talk game -- guess words.

The rules of this game is simple.

Two players. One word one game. 
Suppose player1 get the target word. Then he/she can say any word (expcept for the target word itself) to describle the word he/she got.
And the other is supposed to guess the word from his/her partner's description.

Isn't it interetsing to teach computers to master that game?

However, I failed to acheive that, yet.

Hope someday things will change.
