Deep Q Learning for the game of guessing words


It implements the DQL algorithm as well as serveral recent advances in the field of deep reinforcement learning, applied to a game which is a popular langugae game -- guess words.

The rules of the game is very simple:

1. Two players. One target word one game. 
2. Suppose player1 is the describler, He/She can say any word (expcept for the target word itself) to describle the target word. Player2 is then supposed to guess the word from his/her partner's utterrance.

Isn't it interetsing to teach computers to master the game?

However, I failed to acheive that, yet.

Hope someday things will change.
